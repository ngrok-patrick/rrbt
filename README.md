Little Shortcut Script tool I use for common tasks

I use Keyboard Maestro for a lot of tasks. And I use
Keyboard Maestro to start a Bash Command shell and
execute commands like this:

```
bash -c "$(curl -L -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngrok-patrick/rrbt/main/linux/ip)"
```

I have a Macro, that types everything out, except the Filename,
so I just type the file name, and the script pulls down the
Command I want via Curl, and executes the command.

Doubt anyone will find it Useful.

But, here is a link to Keyboard Maestro for MacOs: https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/
